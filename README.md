## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project I can't point to anything particular that it taught me. This was done more as a learning exercise to improve my CSS design skills. I'm not the best when it comes to css and making websites look decent so I wanted to practice some more and that is where this project came in.

## Acknowledgments

Big thanks to Jessica Chan aka Coder Coder on Youtube for her videos inspiring me to keep at it with my web development journey. I consistently come back to your videos encouraging me to keep learning even when it seems like my efforts aren't getting me anywhere. You are a true inspiration and if not for your video encouragement, I might've given up on coding a long while ago just due to how I tend to be overly critical of myself so thank you very much!
